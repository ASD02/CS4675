The South African was desperately trying to conserve energy as he bids for a 200/400m double but was forced to go deeper than he would have liked by Botswana's Baboloki Thebe in the second of three semi-finals, eventually clocking 44.22 seconds.

He and Conan are both guilty of slamming our president while he s overseas trying to deal with the North Koreans and Chinese. The left will never stop with their bashing of Trump on a very personal level",

However, that is definitely not a value that Speaker Ryan shares. On Friday, Planned Parenthood advocates showed up at his Capitol Hill offices, only to be greeted with guards at every turn. It seemed that Ryan and his cronies were expecting the people to show up, sporting their pink  I Stand With Planned Parenthood  shirts, with boxes and boxes of petitions in tow, signed by tens of thousands of Americans who are demanding answers to Ryan s plans to take away healthcare from millions of American women.When the advocates were blocked by Capitol Hill police, finally a staffer had to escort them to Ryan s office. When they got there, the door was locked and heavily guarded. There was a sign that read, Please knock, only scheduled appointments will be admitted.",

The backlash was so huge that Disney rehired some American workers. So now Obama is going all out to destroy the American worker in the name of cheap foreign labor What a jackwagon!",

In a statement, Egypt's State Information Service (SIS) said Reuters had made grave professional mistakes  by relying on unidentified security sources and not  resorting to official security authorities to get correct information. The Ministry of Interior in an initial statement on Friday did not give any casualty figure for Friday s clashes. On Saturday, a ministry statement said 16 police and conscripts were killed and another 13 wounded in a remote western desert area after they came under heavy fire from the armed group. However, three security sources told Reuters as many as 52 police had been killed in gun battles, which security sources said involved militants firing rockets at a police convoy.",

I should say I ve noticed who they detest also Trump No matter which candidate you support, this isn t fair to the American people who really want the truth in the media to come back. FOX is now no better than the liberal leaning CNN and MSNBC. Watch with caution after you read this excellent piece about the connections between big business, politics and the push for mass immigration to America. Yes folks, it s all about cheap labor and money",

If the Senate confirms Zinke, a Republican, to lead the Interior Department, he will head an agency that employs more than 70,000 people across the country and oversees more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite. As a one-term U.S. congressman, Zinke took several stances favoring coal, which is high in carbon emissions when burned. Coal output suffered during the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama as the development of competing fuels natural gas and solar and wind power soared.",
